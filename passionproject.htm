A black hole is essentially a place where gravity pulls a lot, this gravitational force is so strong that not even light can escape it. The gravity is at an extreme because a black hole takes matter the size of a star larger than our sun and squeezes to about the size of New York City. That also means that if the Earth became a black hole then it would be confined to as little as 1 inch in diameter.</p>

    <p class="has-drop-cap has-foreground-dark-color has-background-light-background-color has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="line-height:1.4">There are many different kinds of black holes, but the main three are stellar black holes, supermassive black holes, and intermediate black holes. The first are called stellar black holes, stellar black holes are parts of gigantic stars. These black holes are formed when a giant star collapses on itself. You're probably asking, why does it collapse on itself? Well, when stars are born they have to mix chemical properties to survive. Eventually these chemical properties make iron, a type of metal. When this happens a star gets unstable and it collapses in on itself, this process repeats which eventually results in a big explosion called a supernova. After the supernova the matter that was once a star turns into a stellar black hole.</p>

Just contemplate the sheer size of this giant of a black hole! These black holes were thought to be made at the very beginning of our universe, they are thought to be made up of huge collapsing clouds made up of interstellar hydrogen. Also, some scientists suggest that these black holes are in the center of most galaxies including our galaxy. The gravitational would be so strong that it could keep all of the matter in that galaxy under its orbit.</p>

The singularity is so dense that its density is almost infinite. Next up we have is the event horizon, the event horizon is the part of the black that surrounds it. The event horizon's gravitational force is so strong that not even light can escape it. This is because it is close enough to the singularity that the pull is very strong.&nbsp; After that there is the Schwarzschild Radius is the event horizon's radius, this radius's escape velocity is as fast as the speed of light! Next, we have the Accretion disk, which is a disk made up of stellar material that spirals towards the black hole. Then last but not least, the Ergosphere, as the black hole rotates its mass causes the spacetime too rotate too, this is called the Ergosphere.</p>

    <p class="has-drop-cap has-foreground-dark-color has-background-light-background-color has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="line-height:1.4">When an object enters a black hole, it undergoes a process called spaghettification. Since the gravity in a black hole is very immense, you essentially get stretched into as thin as a toothpick or even thinner. Time slows down , and after a while you will just hit the singularity. Even though this all seems very real it is actually just theoretical as astronomers don't really know what happens inside a black hole. Astronomers predict that the object won't be turned into cells, not atoms, but into a sea of energy, not a trace of you will be left. Eventually the object would just be part of a black hole and nothing of you would be left.</p>

    <p class="has-drop-cap has-foreground-dark-color has-background-light-background-color has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="line-height:1.4">No one really knows where black holes lead you, but a theory includes wormholes.&nbsp; A wormhole is a "tunnel" that leads to another place, dimension, or time. These wormholes can suddenly collapse if you enter it. Wormholes have 3 parts, a throat, and 2 mouths. The throat is straight and the mouths are bent outwards. Even though many astronomers prove it wrong Einstein's theory of general relativity proves that wormholes can be real, some theories even say that one of the mouths of a wormhole is a black hole. Astronomers say that in the start of their lifetime wormholes start out at about 10^-33 centimeters in diameter. That sounds really tiny, but as the universe expands the wormhole expands with it.&nbsp; You're probably asking, how can we go through a wormhole? Well, there is an exotic matter that astronomers don't know the name of yet, nor do they know if it even exists! If a wormhole had this exotic matter already in it, it would mean that the wormhole could be living for billion and billions of years. This exotic matter which is not dark-matter or antimatter contains a negative energy density and a very large negative pressure to stabilize the wormhole. Wormholes can be used for time travel if the mouth is moved in the proper way, but the addition of "regular" matter could destabilize the portal and the wormhole would collapse. Scientist think they have found a wormhole with negative-mass. Even after all of these humans have a very slight chance of going through a wormhole, and this won't be possible anytime soon.</p>

    <p class="has-drop-cap has-foreground-dark-color has-background-light-background-color has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="line-height:1.4">Telescopes that detect x-rays, light, or any form of electromagnetic radiation cannot detect black holes. Astronomers observe black holes kind of like the way we observe wind. You don't see it but you know it's there by the things around it. Astronomers find black holes by looking at the effects around one, if a black hole traveled through an interstellar matter cloud it would draw matter inwards in a process called accretion. When the attracted matter accelerates, it heats up resulting in it emitting x-rays that radiate into space. Some examples are, powerful gamma ray bursts, eating stars close by, and spurring the growth of nearby stars. Scientists usually find gigantic black holes when another star draws closer to the black hole so that some of it's matter circles around in the black hole's gravity. Some stellar black holes lead isolated lives do nothing and those are impossible to detect. Astronomers find these by detecting the effect on stars and gas around the black hole.</p>

    <p class="has-drop-cap has-foreground-dark-color has-background-light-background-color has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size" style="line-height:1.4">The answer to this question is, yes they do die. Black holes just eventually evaporate, they are not entirely "black" or empty, they give off some energy. Even though they do, a black hole only emits one particle per year! Over an extremely long period of time they simply shrink and pop into a flash of energy. A black hole just a few times larger than our sun will take 10^100 years to evaporate. Astronomers predict that after all the planets have dissolved and all the galaxies have torn themselves apart, black holes will evaporate!</p>
